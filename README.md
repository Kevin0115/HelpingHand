## The Story
Helping Hand is a full-stack web solution that enables seamless donations to homeless people without smartphones/laptops. Powered by a Node/Express + PostgreSQL backend and a React frontend, Helping Hand utilizes a physical QR code printout that is distributed to the homeless. This QR code is their wallet, and can collect donations simply by having a passerby (a Giver) scan their QR code. Once the homeless person (which we call Receivers) has enough funds, they are able to visit a participating Helping Hands merchant (for food, clothes, etc.) and redeem their donation funds. We are particularly proud of the inclusivity and accessibility that our app provides.

## Key Features:
- **No installation necessary**: We use a progressive web-app to avoid the headache of native app installation
- [Studies](https://smashingideas.com/pwa-statistics/) show that PWA's are far better for engaging audiences
- Automatic and immediate unique QR code generation
- Instant transaction and donation updates via PostgreSQL
- Elegant React client
